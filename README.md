# Changing-colors

Python2.7 interactive fun console to change colors

This is an interactive console to change color

You can run the scripts separately, but it is better to combine them to build the hole program.

Copy all the scripts to the same directory, you can copy the Colors Tkinter Console.Desktop file to your desktop, to run them
with the buttons, or just run Colors-Tkinter.py in gnome-terminal like this:

python Colors-Tkinter.py

Hope you like it!

Regards to all.-
